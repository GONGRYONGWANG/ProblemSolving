### 문제 설명

<p>First, for those who have never seen a lamp before, let’s say it is a cuboid (box with rectangular faces) made of glass and filled with gas. All sides of a lamp have integer lengths.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, our lecturer was sentenced for destroying lamps on a street. He must have gone somewhat crazy, as he thought some of the lamps were screaming at him in high-pitched voices.</p>

<p>In his beautiful mind, he followed a weird pattern. He only recognized and destroyed those lamps which had no square face and whose volume did not exceed a fixed value. Later, during a session with his doctor Clarice, he said he was very scared of large objects and of objects with too regular shapes.</p>

<p>Your task is to count all possible shapes matching lecturer’s conditions.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first input line contains a number T of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>). Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>), the maximum recognizable volume of a lamp.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case output the number of different lamp shapes which could have been destroyed in the rage.</p>
